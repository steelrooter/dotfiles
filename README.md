# Sachin's dotfiles

A small start to maintain my computing environment preferences.
Inspired from [Holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)

## install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/steelrooter/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.
